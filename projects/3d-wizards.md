3d-Wizards was my first time doing a group coding project. The implementation is that it took and order from the store or a custom to the cart then once checked out of the cart it would be added to a postgres database. This site was added to vercel and still work as of 12/19 my part of the project was the custom order page and the design.

The store has a working search bar and each of the items blue link takes to a second page a different member made.

The custom order has three parameter being a requestr type, decspirtion and a material. there must be a request type, decsprition and atleast one material selected in order to be added to the database.
