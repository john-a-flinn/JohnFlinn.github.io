The first thing I noticed about the ESLint coding standards is that 
using two spaces for indentation is really frustrating, as I'm used to pressing 
the tab key. It also makes the indentation less clear at a glance. Additionally, 
dealing with trailing spaces at the end of a line, even after a semicolon or a comment, 
feels pointless and tedious to fix. Apart from these issues, the only other errors I’ve 
encountered were related to the improper setup of the TypeScript configuration, which isn’t 
part of the coding standards. I would say that I'm pretty good at basic coding standards since 
the previous college I attended would grade very harshly on not following coding standards.

The above was my original take on ESLint; however, I would revise some points now. First, using spaces instead of tabs is important because tabs can render differently across systems. That said, I still find that using only two spaces for indentation makes the code harder to read at a glance.

Second, while empty spaces at the end of a line may seem insignificant, they can affect indentation, particularly for comments. This is likely why this rule is enforced in linters. Although some of these rules may seem tedious, they are crucial for ensuring consistency within a team. I’ve learned how challenging it can be to read someone else’s code, especially when it follows a different coding style.

Looking back, I realize my coding standards weren’t very strong. While they’ve improved, they are still far from perfect. In the spirit of growth, I’ve chosen to leave this paper in its original format to highlight the progress I’ve made from the beginning to now.
