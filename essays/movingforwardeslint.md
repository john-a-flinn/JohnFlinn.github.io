The first thing I noticed about the ESLint coding standards is that 
using two spaces for indentation is really frustrating, as I'm used to pressing 
the tab key. It also makes the indentation less clear at a glance. Additionally, 
dealing with trailing spaces at the end of a line, even after a semicolon or a comment, 
feels pointless and tedious to fix. Apart from these issues, the only other errors I’ve 
encountered were related to the improper setup of the TypeScript configuration, which isn’t 
part of the coding standards. I would say that I'm pretty good at basic coding standards since 
the previous college I attended would grade very harshly on not following coding standards.

The above was my original take on ESLint; however, I would change some points now. First, using spaces instead of tabs is important since tabs can display differently across systems. I would still agree that only using two spaces makes the code harder to read. Second, having empty spaces at the end of a line doesn't change anything unless it's for comments, where it would affect indentation, which is probably why this rule is included in the linter. I would add that while some of these rules may seem tedious, it is important for everyone in a group to follow the same standards. I would never have guessed how hard it is to read someone else's code—let alone when they use a different coding style. Looking back, I wouldn’t say I had great coding standards back then. While mine are better now, they’re still far from perfect.
