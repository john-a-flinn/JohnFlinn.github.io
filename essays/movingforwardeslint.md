The first thing I noticed about the ESLint coding standards is that 
using two spaces for indentation is really frustrating, as I'm used to pressing 
the tab key. It also makes the indentation less clear at a glance. Additionally, 
dealing with trailing spaces at the end of a line, even after a semicolon or a comment, 
feels pointless and tedious to fix. Apart from these issues, the only other errors I’ve 
encountered were related to the improper setup of the TypeScript configuration, which isn’t 
part of the coding standards. I would say that I'm pretty good at basic coding standards since 
the previous college I attended would grade very harshly on not following coding standards.

Above was my orignal take on ESLint however I would change some. First using spaces instead of tabs is important since tabs can show up differnet depeding from system to system. I would still agree that only using two spaces make the code harder to read. Second having empty space at the end of a line doesn't change anything uless its for comments which it would change the indentation and is probaly the reason its in the moduler. I would add that while some of these may seem tedious it is immporant to have everyone in a group use the same standards. I would have never guessed how hard it is to read someone elses code let alone when they use a differnet coding style. Looking back I wouldnt say I had ok coding standards back then and now better but sill far from perfect.
